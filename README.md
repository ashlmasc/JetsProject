# Jets Project

### Program Overview
This project is an application that lists the different types of jets that are in the airfield. There is an option menu that will display and prompt the user to pick 1 of 9 options such as listing the fleet, flying the jets, view fastest jet, and jet with the longest range. The user can also insert a jet into the airfield as well as delete a jet from the airfield. There is also a quit option on the menu for the user to exit the program.

### How to Run
When you run the program, you will be presented with the following list of menu options to choose from.
 
 1. List fleet   
 2. Fly all jets                
 3. View fastest jet 
 4. View jet with longest range 
 5. Load all Cargo Jets        
 6. Dogfight!           
 7. Add a jet to fleet           
 8. Remove a jet from fleet     
 9. Quit  
 
After selecting your desired menu option, follow the prompts of the menu item. You must select the quit option to exit the program.

### Topics/Technologies Used
Some new topics that I used in this program were arrayLists. ArrayLists were used to maintain the jets in order and to remove and add as many jets as the user would like. I used switch statements to iterate through each of the user's choices. I used to loops keep the program running until the user decides to quit the program.

### Lessons Learned
This was definitely a difficult project to complete. I struggled most with calling objects correctly and writing the syntax correctly. I think this project did help me to get a better understanding of Inheritance and Polymorphism. I also have a better grasp on interfaces and how they work after working on this project.  Honestly, I ended getting caught up on something simple like trying to print an object without overriding its toString() method and it took me way longer than it should have to realize I needed to add a toString() in order to print out what I wanted to print out correctly.
